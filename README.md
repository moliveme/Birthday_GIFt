## Data Needed To Form The Deck

- Elixir Cost
- Health Points
- Damage
- Hit Speed
- Damage Per Second
- User's Top 2 Fvaorite Cards
- The purpose of the deck (Offensive? Defensive?), input by the user

### The Data Comes Together

- Deck must have around a 4.0 average elixir cost
- The two cards that the user prefers must be in the deck
- The other 6 cards in the deck are built around it. For example, if the user's prefered cards are splash damage, then none of the other cards must be splash damage. 
- If the deck is for defence, add more building cards (eg. bomb tower, x-bow, etc.). Else, add more splash damage cards and heavy damage cards.
- After these constraints, try to maximize total health points/damage/hit speed of the deck.
